## The Monkees

This Project focuses on the Band The Monkees who were very successful in the 1960s.
The website has been developed to announce their "comeback" and publicize their intentions to perform at small venues such as weddings, christenings etc.

On the home section of the page there is a brief introduction with some intentionally placed song lyrics to catch the eye, and a link button straight to booking section.

Following sections give visitors a chance to listen to a select number of songs from their reportoire, view a small number of music videos and gain easy access to the bands youtube page, should users wish to see more.

The Website also has an image section so users can see who the band members are and lastly it features a booking request section so potential bookers can contact them easily if they like what they see and hear.

## UX

This Website is aimed at fans, new or existing and venue hosts who wish to book the band for a performance, be it a christmas party, themed night, wedding, prom night.
The website provides the means to do this. It also provides information on the bands availability for the current month.

Aswell as being able to listen to few songs written and performed by the band on the website, users also have access to a full catalogue of audio and video clips via links on the page.

There is an image gallery section which provides a small selection of images of the band members. And links to their verified social media pages so potential fans can follow the latest news and gossip.

* As the owner of a venue it is my job to book acts for our busy weekends, I would like to hear how an act looks and sounds before booking.
* As a new fan, I would like to listen to more of their songs and possibly book them for a 60s theme night.
* As the owner of a venue I would like to check their availabilty to see if when they are free to perform at my venue when i need them to.
* As a fan i would like access to their social media pages so i can follow them and keep updated on the latest news about them.
